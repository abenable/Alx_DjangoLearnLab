## Implementing and Interacting with Django Models

A Django app named `bookshelf` has been created with a Book model (fields: title, author, publication_year).  
Perform basic CRUD operations via the Django shell; see the files create.md, retrieve.md, update.md, delete.md and CRUD_operations.md for details.
